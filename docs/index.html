            <p>
                The term responsive design was coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010 and described the use of three techniques in combination.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in Marcotte's article, Fluid Grids (published in 2009 on A List Apart).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second technique was the idea of fluid images. Using a very simple technique of setting the max-width property to 100%, images would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixellated if the column becomes wider than the image.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third key component was the media query. Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design isn't a separate technology</strong> — it is a term used to describe an approach to web design or a set of best practices, used to create a layout that can respond to the device being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration this meant flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS layout methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.
            </p>

    <section id="Media_Queries" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query. The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a Candidate Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was deemed ready for implementation in browsers. Media Queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide. The CSS for the .container selector will only be applied if these two things are true.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">.container {</pre>
            <pre class="tab2">margin: 1em 2em;</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">}</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as breakpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones), then check for larger screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. This is often described as mobile first design.

            <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In Flexbox, flex items will shrink and distribute space between the items according to the space in their container, as their initial behavior. By changing the values for flex-grow and flex-shrink you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of flex: 1 as described in the layout topic Flexbox: Flexible sizing of flex items.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">.container {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">display: flex;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
            <br>
            <pre class="notab">.item {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">flex: 1;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>

        <p>
            In CSS Grid Layout the fr unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at 1fr. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container. You can find out more about this approach to create a grid in the Learn Layout Grids topic, under Flexible grids with the fr unit.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">.container {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">display: grid;</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;</pre>

            <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The simplest approach to responsive images was as described in Marcotte's early articles on responsive design. Basically, you would take an image that was at the largest size that might be needed, and scale it down. This is still an approach used today, and in most stylesheets, you will find the following CSS somewhere:
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">img {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">max-width: 100%;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            There are obvious downsides to this approach. The image might be displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, which is a waste of bandwidth — a mobile user may be downloading an image several times the size of what they actually see in the browser window. In addition, you may not want the same image aspect ratio on mobile as on desktop. For example, it might be nice to have a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop. Or, acknowledging the smaller size of an image on mobile you might want to show a different image altogether, one which is more easily understood at a small screen size. These things can't be achieved by simply scaling down an image.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsive Images, using the <picture> element and the <img> srcset and sizes attributes solve both of these problems. You can provide multiple sizes along with "hints" (meta data that describes the screen size and resolution the image is best suited for), and the browser will choose the most appropriate image for each device, ensuring that a user will download an image size appropriate for the device they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also art direct images used at different sizes, thus providing a different crop or completely different image to different screen sizes.

            <h2>Responsive Typography</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            An element of responsive design not covered in earlier work was the idea of responsive typography. Essentially, this describes changing font sizes within media queries to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be 4rem, meaning it will be four times our base font size. That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least 1200px.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">html {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">font-size: 1em;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
            <pre class="notab">h1 {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">font-size: 2rem;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
            <pre class="notab">@media (min-width: 1200px) {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">h1 {</pre>
            <pre class="tab2">font-size: 4rem;</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">}</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
        </code>
        <h3>Using Viewport Units for Responsive Typography</h3>
        <p>
            An interesting approach is to use the viewport unit vw to enable responsive typography. 1vw is equal to one percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font size using vw, it will always relate to the size of the viewport.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">h1 {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">font-size: 6vw;</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            The problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the vw unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport. <strong>Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a solution, and it involves using calc(). If you add the vw unit to a value set using a fixed size such as ems or rems then the text will still be zoomable. Essentially, the vw unit adds on top of that zoomed value:
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre class="notab">h1 {</pre>
            <pre class="tab1">front-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw);</pre>
            <pre class="notab">}</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries. The font then gradually increases as you increase the size of the viewport.
